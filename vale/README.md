# Vale for Adhering to Consistent Documentation Style

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source, command-line tool that we, at Scalar, use for our editorial style guide. Let's look at this.

Rather than building a style guide from the ground up, which takes a considerable amount of time, we're leveraging many styles from the Vale-compatible versions of the following:

- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft)
- [proselint](https://github.com/errata-ai/proselint)
